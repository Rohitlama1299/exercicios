  <h3>Floras of Portugal</h3>
  <p>Portugal has a diverse range of flora due to its varied geography, climate, and soil types. The country's flora is 
    influenced by its Mediterranean climate, with dry summers and mild, wet winters. There are around 4,500 species of 
    plants found in Portugal, including endemic and rare species.</p>

  <p>One of the most well-known trees in Portugal is the cork oak (Quercus suber), which is found in large numbers in 
    the south of the country. The bark of the cork oak is harvested to produce cork, which is used in a variety of 
    products such as wine stoppers and flooring.</p>

  <p>Another iconic tree in Portugal is the olive tree (Olea europaea), which is widely cultivated in the country for 
    its fruit and oil. Portugal is also home to a variety of fruit trees, such as figs (Ficus carica), almonds (Prunus dulcis),
     and oranges (Citrus sinensis).</p>
  <p>In coastal areas, Portugal's flora includes species adapted to the harsh and salty conditions, such as the sea l
    avender (Limonium spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium spp.). In the mountains, there are alpine species, such as the 
    snowbell (Soldanella villosa) and the edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum).</p>      
  <p>Overall, Portugal's flora is diverse and includes a wide range of species that are adapted to the country's 
    different environments, making it a fascinating place for plant enthusiasts to explore.</p>
